# AudioStitch2
This is a continuation of AudioStitch

This project is a continuation of what I was doing in [AudioStitch](http://github.com/wodinga/audiostitch), except as a compiled project rather than a Swift playground. I am now able to stitch together other shows concurrently instead of just one at a time.
